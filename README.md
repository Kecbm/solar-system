# Skills
In this project, I was able to:

   * Use JSX in React

   * Correctly use the `render()` method to render your components

   * Use `import` to bring components into different files

   * Create class components in React

   * Create multiple components from an array

   * Make use of `props` correctly

   * Make use of `PropTypes` to validate the `props of a component`

## What was developed

In this project I developed an application in React with creating class components and passing props. This application will simulate a visualization of the **Solar System**, as well as information about various space missions that have occurred throughout history. When using this application, a user must be able to:

   * View all planets in the solar system rendered on the screen;

   * View all cards with information about space missions;

## Files made available by Trybe

The data, images and planets folders were provided by Trybe.
